# News-app---Stage-2
News app - Stage 2
This application was part of the Nanodegree program.
Basic idea is to obtain news data via JSON responce from The Guardian server
and display them on scree.
User can pick up from some news topic via setting options.

For Nanodegree program was not neccersary to implement image
but finaly I rebuild this app with Recycler view and I added image from JSON responce.
